# ResearcherRecommender

A recommendation system is one of the applications of machine learning that leverages data to predict or suggest objects, content, or services relevant to the user. In the academic context, similar systems have been used to identify relevant researchers. However, many existing solutions are still limited to keyword matching or basic statistical approaches, which are less effective at capturing the semantic meaning and deeper context of a research topic. Therefore, this study aims to develop a researcher recommendation system based on publication records using transformer-based language models and similarity-distance metrics. The system is designed to provide researcher name recommendations that are relevant to the user's input topic. Experiments are conducted by testing combinations of several key parameters, including data variations, language models, and similarity-distance metrics, to find the most optimal configuration against the ground truth. To evaluate the performance of the developed recommendation system, this study uses a set of evaluation metrics that include both Top-K and beyond-accuracy metrics. These evaluations aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the system’s effectiveness and quality. The dataset used in this study consists of textual data obtained from the institution’s research information management platform.
